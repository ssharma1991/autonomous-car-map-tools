# Map Tools

This repository is used to analyze, plot, and generate map data for autonomous driving purposes.

## Drive Simulator
It is a Python tool designed to generate synthetic drive data between multiple locations. The tool first creates a route between waypoints, then simulates GNSS data generated by a virtual vehicle driving along the route, and saves it as a CSV file. This simulated drive data includes timestamps, latitude, longitude, altitude, and speed information. The waypoint, route, and drive data can be plotted on either a static map or an interactive map.

The static map plotter downloads tile data from OpenStreetMap, stitches them together, plots the background map, and overlays the route and drive data. Downloaded tile data is cached to avoid unnecessary downloads.

The interactive map plotter opens a separate browser window (using Plotly) and plots the calculated route. The map is interactive, allowing zooming and panning. It also provides the flexibility to switch the basemap between satellite view and OpenStreetMap tiles.

Run the command `python3 drive_simulator/demo.py` to simulate a drive ([demo_virtual_drive.csv](./drive_simulator/demo_virtual_drive.csv)) in the San Francisco Bay Area. For this demo, the following static and interactive maps are generated:

## TODO
- **Area Analysis**:
    - Display highways and local roads in different colors (e.g., plot all highways in the San Francisco Bay Area).
- **Route Analysis**:
    - Visualize "nearby" highway data during the drive (implement a drive timestamp slider).
- Consider renaming the repository to "autonomous-car-map-tools."
